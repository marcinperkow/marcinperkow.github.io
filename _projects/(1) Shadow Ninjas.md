# Shadow Ninjas

The vision for this game is to put a new and unique spin on the average puzzler, platformer, or some combination of the two genres. To do so, the player will have to put themselves in the mindset of a ninja to act in the dark and progress through levels without alerting enemies. Several kinds of obstacles and puzzles will be laid out within a map, and the puzzle aspect of this game is to navigate around these obstacles, which are the openly lit areas and the enemies themselves. Some of this navigation will come in the form of a platforming, or skilled jumps and maneuvering to get from one point to another.\
The obstacles previously mentioned will be primarily in the form of sensical light sources, such as torches, campfires or even sunlight. The player will have limited resources to interact with the environment in several ways so that they can either extinguish these light sources to sneak past them or avoid them entirely. One such example is to throw a ninja star at a torch to extinguish it or drop a crate onto a campfire, thus suffocating the flame. Removing these light sources will present the player with new paths to traverse closer towards the goal. As a result, players must think about their choices before attempting to physically make their way towards the goal.
