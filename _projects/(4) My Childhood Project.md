# My Childhood Project

I tried to recreate my childhood playground. I used to live there for about 14 years and that is the most home place I can think of. With skills and time limitations it's a very rough attempt. I think that this encaptulates what childhood means to me. The goal is to hit 5 plates with balls using left mouse button. This recreates me and my friends throwing the ball at the sign at out appartment block.
