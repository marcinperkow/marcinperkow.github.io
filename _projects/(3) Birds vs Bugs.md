# Birds vs Bugs

Overall light simulates inside lights of PC, button is just a PC button, ball is a debug object that helps eliminate bugs and finally bug billboard stares at you all the time and you can't get rid off it as a metaphor for coders. Whole game has working networking with host and clients. Eliminating all 10 bugs is the main goal.
